        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Write your coordinates in <em>Initial X</em> and <em>Initial Z</em>. Throw the eye of
        ender and place yourself right under it when it's hovering in the air.
        Write your new coordinates in <em>Final X</em> and <em>Final Z</em> and
        press <em>Add measurement</em>.</p>
        <p>You'll get an estimate of the Stronghold's position as soon as you
        have two measurements. In order to improve its accuracy, you should take your measurements far away from each other. After
        taking the first measurement, move several hundred blocks to either
        side. This prevents bearings which are close to parallel (bad
        for estimation). Taking additional measurements also improves accuracy.</p>

            <img src="accuracy2.png" /><br />
            <strong>Bad: </strong>Close starting points amplify measurement
            errors, giving you a bad estimate.
        </div>
        <div class="caption" style="width: 365px;">
            <img src="accuracy1.png" /><br />
            <strong>Good: </strong>Far away measurements give you an accurate
            estimate.
        </div>
        <div class="caption" style="width: 400px;">
            <img src="accuracy3.png" /><br />
            <strong>Better: </strong>Additional measurements give you an even
            better bearing.
        </div>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>Each time you throw an Eye of Ender, the game is telling you that the
        Stronghold is somewhere on a line that passes through the throwing 
        point and the landing point. So if you throw twice, from different 
        locations, you know the Stronghold is in the intersection of those two 
        lines.</p>
        <p>However, there is a certain amount of error associated with each
        measurement. To combat this, you can take more than two measurements,
        which makes errors tend to cancel out. Since three or more lines don't
        usually intersect in a single point, the assistant looks for the
        point which is closest to all of the lines. It does this using a
        mathematical technique called <a

            Least Squares</a></p>
